# Pomotimer (A Project by Aadam Mirza)
A simple C++ based timer for use with the 'Pomodoro' Studying method; I searched for an intuitive way of setting customizable times for work and rest, but couldn't find one I liked, and decided to take it upon myself to make one. For any students using this to study, hope it helps!

Need to do:
1) Actually Get the timer function of the program working (Done using std::sleep)
2) Give the user the option to endlessly cycle the two phases and not just do the rest and work phase once (done with a switch statement)
3) Have the program play sounds when a phase completes so you don't have to constantly have it open: Still a work in progress, would welcome any advice on this one.

The two sound files used for this project were both downloaded from Streamlabs' sound libraries, and are copyright free (as stated by Streamlabs themselves here https://streamlabs.com/alert-sounds-and-effects). The two sound effects in question; work_concluded (originally 'New Message 5') and rest_concluded (originally 'Bells 01') are therefore used in violation of any laws._  
_2. This project is open source, so you can customize it however you wish! Naturally, my only ask is that you use it responsibly._
